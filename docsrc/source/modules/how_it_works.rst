LOVE-manager parts
==================
The LOVE-manager is composed by different software components, as explained below.

Auth API
--------
Provides an HTTP API with endpoints to request and validate access tokens.

When a client (LOVE-frontend) tries to login it sends the users credentials (user and password) through an HTTP request to the API, which responds with the token (if the credentials are valid) or an error (if the credentials are invalid). The validation is performed by searching the given user in the :code:`DB` and comparing the given password with the user's password in the :code:`DB`.

The Auth API also provides additional information in its responses, such as the users permissions and the current server time in diffent formats (UTC, TAI, Sidereal, among others). For more details please see the :ref:`Authentication` section.

UI Framework API
----------------
Provides a REST API with endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on UI Frmework Views. The views contents, layout and configuration are saved as a JSON string in the database.

Commander API
----------------
Provides an HTTP API with endpoints to run Commands.
When a client (like a :code:`LOVE-Frontend` instance) requests a Command, the :code:`Commander API` sends the request to the :code:`LOVE-Commander`.

When the :code:`LOVE-Commander` receives the request, it runs the Command using :code:`salobj` and waits for its acknowledgement. Once the acknowledgement is received, the :code:`LOVE-Commander` sends the acknowledgement in the request's response.
Similarly, the :code:`Commander API`sends the acknowledgement in its response to the client request.

Additionally, the :code:`Commander API` provides endpoints to request genera information from SAL (SAL Info). These requests are also handled by the :code:`LOVE-Commander`.

Consumers
---------
Once the client (LOVE-frontend) has an access token, it can establish a websocket connection with LOVE-manager's :code:`Channels Layer`. Each client (LOVE-frontend) instance is connected to a unique :code:`Consumer` instance, which handles the communication with that particular client.
Similarly, a :code:`Consumer` also handles the communication with a LOVE-producer instance.

Each :code:`consumer` communicates only with its corresponding client. In order to receive messages, the consumer of a client must subscribe to a given group.
When a client sends a message to a group, it is forwarded to all the consumers subscribed to that group, which in turn send the message to their corresponding clients. All the message routing is done in the :code:`Channels Layer`.

Channel Layer
-------------
The :code:`Channels Layer` acts as the message handler, and is in charge of making sure every consumer receives the messages from the groups it has subscribed to.
When a client sends a message to its :code:`Consumer`, it is forwarded to the :code:`Channels Layer`. The :code:`Channels Layer` forwards the message to all the consumers subscribed to the group, and each consumer forwards the messages to its corresponding client.

Database
--------
The :code:`DB` is used to model and store the users data (username, password and permissions), and the UI Framework views. It is currently configured to be a :code:`PostgreSQL` instance, and it is initialized with default users and groups.

Example
=======
In the figure above, we can see that :code:`Frontend 1` subscribes to telemetry :code:`tel1` while :code:`Frontend 2` subscribes to telemetries :code:`tel1` and :code:`tel2`.
When :code:`Producer` sends a value for :code:`tel1` to its consumer :code:`Consumer producer`, the latter forwards :code:`tel1` to the :code:`Channels Layer`, which forwards :code:`tel1` to :code:`Consumer 1` and :code:`Consumer 2`, each of which send :code:`tel1` to  :code:`Frontend 1` and :code:`Frontend 2` respectively.

Then, when :code:`Producer` sends a value for :code:`tel2` to :code:`Consumer producer`, the latter forwards :code:`tel2` to the :code:`Channels Layer`, which forwards :code:`tel2` to :code:`Consumer 2` only. Then :code:`Consumer 2` forwards the message to :code:`Frontend 2`.
In this case :code:`Frontend 1` (and :code:`Consumer 1`) never received :code:`tel2` because its not part of :code:`Consumer 1` subscriptions.


Code organization
==================

Currently the application is divided in the following modules and files:

* :code:`api`: This module contains the :code:`API` Django app, which defines the models and API endpoints for authentication (:code:`Auth API`) and Commander (:code:`Commander API`) APIs. For more details please refer to the :ref:`ApiDoc` section
* :code:`ui_framework`: This module contains the :code:`UI Framework` Django app, which defines the models and API endpoints for the UI Framework views (:code:`UI Framework API`) API. For more details please refer to the :ref:`ApiDoc` section
* :code:`subscription`: This module contains the Django app that defines the consumers that handle the websocket communication.
* :code:`manager`: This module contains basic Django configuration files, such as urls and channels routing, etc.
* :code:`manage.py`: This module is the main executable of the Django application, used mostly for development purposes, but also to execute some actions over the database, such as applying migrations, saving data from fixtures, etc.
* :code:`pytest.ini`: This is the configuration file for the Pytest testing module.
* :code:`requierements.txt`: This file defines the python libraries required by the application.
* :code:`runserver.sh` and :code:`runserver-dev.sh`: These are simple scripts used to run the application inside the docker images.
